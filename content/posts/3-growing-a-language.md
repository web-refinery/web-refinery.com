Yesterday I was looking up a couple of things, and I landed on [Thomas Ballinger's website](https://ballingt.com/). Specifically the article about [Garbage Collection](https://ballingt.com/garbage-collection). I only actual understood the point of the article after watching Guy Steel's talk "[Growing a Language (on YouTube)](https://youtu.be/lw6TaiXzHAE)" or [read it here (PDF via archive.org)](http://web.archive.org/web/20210828021438/https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/steele.pdf).

I highly recommend it. 

Here are a couple more things that are interesting: [Dal Segno](http://dalsegno.ballingt.com), [Crafting Interpreters (by Robert Nystrom)](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)
