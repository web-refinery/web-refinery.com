Discovered [NixOS/NixPkgs](https://nixos.org) and I've been running it (mostly) happily since. It feels more empowering to manage my machines and configurations instead of the usual shell scripts, (bare) dotfile repositories, Ansible & Saltstack. Track my [home-manager's](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration [here on GitHub](https://github.com/xanderificnl/home)

(I would still use Ansible or Saltstack for [fleets of] machines that aren't tailored to my specific needs.)

Also discovered [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) but after some [reading](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/620322/is-there-a-guix-equivalent-of-nix-shell) I decided to skip it in favor of Nix for now.
